## üîê API Security

Ensuring the security of the API is essential for protecting sensitive user data, maintaining trust, and safeguarding financial transactions. The following security measures will be implemented to provide a secure backend environment:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Authentication (JWT)
- **Implementation**: Secure user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Purpose**: Ensures that only verified users can access protected resources like bookings or payments.
- **Importance**: Protects user accounts from unauthorized access, especially for sensitive actions like bookings or updating profiles.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ OAuth Integration
- **Implementation**: Support OAuth 2.0 authentication with popular providers such as Google and Facebook.
- **Purpose**: Allows users to securely log in with existing accounts from trusted platforms.
- **Importance**: Reduces friction in user registration, enhances security by relying on providers with advanced security systems, and protects against password reuse attacks.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Authorization
- **Implementation**: Role-based access control (RBAC) to differentiate between regular users (guests), hosts, and admin users.
- **Purpose**: Limits what each type of user can do within the system.
- **Importance**: Prevents unauthorized actions, such as one user modifying another‚Äôs booking or accessing restricted admin features.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Encryption
- **Implementation**: Use HTTPS/TLS encryption for all network communications.
- **Purpose**: Protects data transmitted between the client and server.
- **Importance**: Prevents man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks that could steal sensitive information like passwords or payment details.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Rate Limiting & Throttling
- **Implementation**: Apply rate limiting to critical API endpoints (e.g., login, payments).
- **Purpose**: Controls the number of requests a client can make in a given time window.
- **Importance**: Prevents abuse through brute-force attacks, spamming, or Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Secure Payments
- **Implementation**: Integrate with trusted third-party payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, Paystack).
- **Purpose**: Offloads sensitive payment data handling to PCI-DSS-compliant providers.
- **Importance**: Protects financial transactions and minimizes exposure of sensitive credit card data.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Implementation**: Validate and sanitize all incoming data to APIs.
- **Purpose**: Prevents common vulnerabilities like SQL Injection and Cross-site Scripting (XSS).
- **Importance**: Ensures the integrity of backend operations and protects database integrity.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Logging & Monitoring
- **Implementation**: Log key activities and errors while avoiding logging sensitive data like passwords.
- **Purpose**: Enables early detection of suspicious activities or breaches.
- **Importance**: Helps maintain accountability and provides insights during security incident investigations.

---

### Why Security is Crucial
- **Protecting User Data**: Safeguards personal and sensitive information from malicious actors.
- **Securing Payments**: Prevents financial fraud and ensures trust in transaction processing.
- **Maintaining Platform Integrity**: Protects the platform from being compromised, keeping it reliable for users and hosts.

# üê≥ Deployment

## ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment**. It is a development practice where code changes are automatically tested and deployed to production environments through automated pipelines. CI/CD ensures that new features, bug fixes, and updates can be delivered quickly, reliably, and with minimal manual intervention.

### Why CI/CD is Important
- **Faster Development Cycles**: Automates repetitive tasks like testing, building, and deployment, allowing developers to focus on writing code.
- **Improved Code Quality**: Automated testing helps catch bugs early in the development process.
- **Reliable Deployments**: Minimizes the risk of human error during deployments, ensuring that each release is consistent.
- **Collaboration Friendly**: Makes it easier for teams to work together by integrating changes frequently without conflicts.

### Tools Used
| Tool             | Purpose                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **GitHub Actions** | Automate tests, builds, and deployments |
| **Docker**       | Ensures consistent environments for development, testing, and production |
| **Docker Compose** | Defines and manages multi-container Docker applications |
| **Heroku / AWS / DigitalOcean** | Deployment platforms for hosting the backend |
| **PostgreSQL**   | Database used in both local and production environments |
| **Celery & Redis** | For managing asynchronous background tasks |

Optional integrations can include:
- **Sentry** or **Prometheus** for error monitoring and performance tracking.
- **Slack or Email notifications** for deployment status updates.
